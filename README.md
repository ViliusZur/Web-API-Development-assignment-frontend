<h1>About the assignment</h1>

The purpose of this assignment was to:
-Develop a secure, open-standards-based API to support server-client communication.
-Create modern web content involving asynchronous data retrieval, client-side DOM
manipulation, standards adherence and user-user interaction
-Manage data persistence across both server and client web-based solutions.
-Design and implement an API and client based on given, non-trivial requirements using a range
of appropriate developer tools.

The development of a website for searching recipes was assigned to my team. The frontend was developed using React.js.
